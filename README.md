# Snow-to-Liquid Ratio study
A statistical analysis of the relationship between surface observations and Snow-to-Liquid Ratio  

**Intro**:  
- Accurate winter snowfall forecasting requires not only precise precipitation prediction but also consideration of the Snow-to-Liquid Ratio (SLR), which determines how much snowfall accumulates from a given amount of liquid precipitation.
- SLR varies depending on snow particle characteristics and compaction effects and is highly sensitive to subtle atmospheric conditions such as temperature changes, making it difficult to characterize accurately.
- Using snowfall observations from laser snow depth sensors (introduced by KMA in 2014; currently 643 sites), this study analyzes (1) the relationship between surface meteorological variables and SLR, and (2) regional differences in SLR characteristics.

**Hypothesis Testing on SLR Characteristics**:
- Snow accumulation is more efficient (higher SLR) at lower temperatures and less efficient (lower SLR) at higher temperatures.
- Larger precipitation amounts reduce SLR due to compaction effects from snow weight.
- When snow falls on an already snow-covered surface, additional compaction reduces the efficiency of snow accumulation (lower SLR).
→ All hypotheses were statistically significant (p-value tests).
